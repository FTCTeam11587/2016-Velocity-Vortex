The Starry Knights were organized in 2016 at Imago Dei Academy in Alamogordo, New Mexico.  Imago Dei Academy is a classical Christian school with a strong academic focus on classical liberal arts.  In 2016, the School Board decided to increase the school's emphasis on STEM activities to develop more well-rounded graduates.  FTC Team #11587 was formed as part of the school's increased STEM focus.  Team #11587 has grown significantly since its beginning and now includes not only IDA students, but also team members from local public and home schools.  Major team milestones include:

The \fIStarry Knights\fP organized in September 2016 at Imago Dei Academy in Alamogordo, New Mexico under the guidance of Head Coach Deneen Black.  Imago Dei Academy is a private classical Christian school with an academic focus that traditionally has been strong in liberal arts education.  In 2016 the school board decided to increase the school's focus on STEM activities to develop more well-rounded graduates.  The \fIKnights\fP organized and quickly expanded our membership to include not only IDA students, but also students from local public and homeschools.

.PP
When the team initially formed, none of our members had any experience in robotics or computer programming.  For the first two months, our learning curve was very steep!  In late October 2016 we reached the point of having a basic functioning robot, leaving us approximately six weeks before our first competition to develop OpModes and Driver code.  We settled on a strategy of simple, basic maneuvers during the Autonomous period, and focused on Driver skill in accomplishing Beacon claims during the Driver period of a match.  This approach resulted in a 2nd place finish at the Alamogordo FTC Competition in mid-December.  We could not have succeeded at the Alamogordo competition without the help of the FTC R\*{2\*}D\*{2\*} Team from Alamogordo, who graciously supplied us with tool boxes, shared work space, and plenty of encouragement as we prepared for our first competition.

 We were able to "pay it forward" by taking the opportunity to support and mentor two FIRST\[rg] Lego League teams at our school during the fall season.

.PP
Our 2nd place finish at Alamogordo secured us a spot at the Arizona/New Mexico Championship being held at Flagstaff in February 2017.  We quickly realized we needed to step up our game significantly to be competitive at that match.  We reorganized, went back to the drawing board, and identified three target tasks for our robot to allow us to remain competitive at the inter-state match.  Under the guidance of our new Head Coach, Kurt Kochendarfer, we tore our robot all the way down to the basic drivetrain and started a rebuild to meet our target goals.  During this time our team also branched out to accomplish an increased focus on community outreach, fundraising/support, and Team spirit!  Along the journey we've had lots of opportunities to learn, to teach, and to grow in our understanding of and appreciation for science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  FIRST\[rg] Tech Challenge has allowed us to meet and exceed our School Board's expectations for STEM development.  The credit for all of this goes, first and foremost, to God.

\fIgroff\fP Document Processing
.XE

.PP
After reviewing several different options for engineering documentation, the Project Management team settled on using \fIGNU troff\fP, or \fIgroff\fP, for documentation of our project.  \fIgroff\fP has a history which goes back to the implementation of the \fItroff\fP program at AT&T Bell Labs Patents Division in 1971.  Engineers at the Patents Division sought an efficient, consistent way to document patent applications, which often contained images, diagrams, complex equations, and other highly technical content.  \fItroff\fP was developed as a way to produce complex documents with a simple, easy-to-learn markup language.  Considering the lack of word processors at the time it was developed, \fItroff\fP was revolutionary in its day.

.PP
 \fIgroff\fP is the GNU version of the original AT&T \fItroff\fP code.  \fIgroff\fP differs from a modern word processor primarily in the fact that content is somewhat divorced from formatting.  In a modern WSYWYG (what you see is what you get) word processor, the formatting displayed on the screen is a close approximation of the formatting that will show up in a print version of the prepared document.  While this method is suitable for casual use and simple applications, scripted document processing using a markup language generates more consistent results with complex documents such as engineering/technical writing.

.PP
In addition to producing beautiful output, \fIgroff\fP was selected because input can be accomplished with a simple text editor, or even directly in the Edit function built into the website at our GitHub repository.  This allowed easy editing and input without the requirement for complex or expensive editing software.  Using simple text input, the Team was able to quickly capture meeting notes, ideas, and other documentation.  Prior to final production, the notes could be scrubbed and \fIgroff\fP markdown applied to quickly and properly format project documentation.  \fIgroff\fP also gave us the ability to not only output our documentation in .pdf format, but with the application of various post-processors we had the ability to port our Engineering Notebook to HTML, and other web-friendly formats.

GitHub Website

GitHub

.PP
The Team utilized the GitHub website (https://github.com) as a cloud-based library to house various aspects of our project.  GitHub is a front-end for the \fIgit\fP version control system, and adds some simple, but effective project management tools.  In addition to the control code for our robot, the Team found that GitHub could be used to store, and even edit, the \fIgroff\fP markup for the electronic copy of our Engineering Notebook.  This made multi-user contributions to the Engineering Notebook easy to manage, while ensuring everyone had the latest update.  GitHub was also useful for storing the source code to project components designed in OpenSCAD, allowing Team members to quickly access components for modification or 3D printing.

To accomplish our objective of executing the cap ball lift into the Center Vortex during End Game, the Build Team decided to utilize a scissor lift mechanism to raise the cap ball into the Center Vortex.  While several other designs were considered, including a cascading pulley lift, the Build Team favored the scissor lift for its simplicity and strength (Figure X)

.PSPIC ./images/CapBallLiftInitialSketch.eps

"\fBFigure X.\fP" "\fICap Ball Lift Sketch\fP";

.PP
Significant engineering research was required to ensure that components in the scissor lift would safely support the load of both the cap ball and the grapple assembly.  The sketch at Figure X is a component diagram of the structural assembly with factor variables denoted.  Assuming the grapple assembly would be attached at two points at the top of the scissor mechanism, two equations were used to calculate the loads imposed on the lifting structure:

L sub y sub 1 = L sub y sub 2 = W over 2

The arms used in our scissor lift were designed with the OpenSCAD software, which allowed us to 3D print the final components.  The 3D printer available to us had a 255mm lateral print limitation which forced a component redesign after our initial attempt.  Our first scissor arm was designed to be printed as one piece on the 255mm print bed, but the resulting 240mm scissor arm was not sturdy enough to support the weight of the cap ball plus our grapple mechanism.

 Our second scissor arm design broke the arm component into two 235mm pieces with an overlap joint which could be bolted together post-print (Figure XX).  With the designed overlap, this gave us a final scissor arm length of 440mm.  The scissor arm was designed using a simple I-beam construct with a 12.5mm flange width and a 6mm thick web.  The through-bolt pivot joints were cylindrically reinforced for torsional strength (Figure XX):
